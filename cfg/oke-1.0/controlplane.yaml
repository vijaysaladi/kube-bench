          Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes 
          client certificate authentication. You can verify the availability of client certificates 
          in your OKE cluster. Run the following command to verify the availability of client certificates 
          in your OKE cluster: 
          
          kubectl get secrets --namespace kube-system
          
          This command lists all the secrets in the kube-system namespace, which includes the client 
          certificates used for authentication. Look for secrets with names starting with oci- or oke-. 
          These secrets contain the client certificates. If the command returns secrets with such names, 
          it indicates that client certificates are available in your OKE cluster.

          Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented 
          in place of client certificates. You can remediate the availability of client certificates in 
          your OKE cluster.
